## GitHub

GitHub is a website for storing and sharing software source code. You're on GitHub right now!

[Create an account](https://github.com/join) by choosing an appropriate username and clicking _Create an account_. Message [emddudley](https://github.com/emddudley) with your GitHub username and he will add you to the [Arctic Warriors](https://github.com/ArcticWarriors) organization on GitHub.

Download and install [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). This is a free application that will make it easy to upload and download code to and from the GitHub website.

When you run GitHub for Windows the first time it will ask you for your GitHub credentials. Enter them and click Log In. Then it will ask you to configure a Name and Email address. These will be publicly visible on the internet, so choose a name and email address that you are comfortable with everyone seeing. You can enter whatever you want in these fields, but please choose something the mentors can use to identify you. Lastly GitHub will ask you to add repositories. Click Skip.
