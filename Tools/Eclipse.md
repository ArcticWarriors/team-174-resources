## Eclipse

Eclipse is a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It's like a fancy text editor for writing code.

Download [Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) (yes, we're doing Java, but apparently this is the version we need). You'll have to click through to a file mirror.

Unzip the file to a logical location, such as `C:\Program Files\eclipse`. You may then want to create a shortcut to `eclipse.exe` or pin it to your taskbar.

When you run Eclipse for the first time it will prompt you for a workspace location. This is where it will save files. You can use the default location, or enter a custom one.

Then you may need to add Java to Eclipse. Once Eclipse is running take the following steps (quoted from the official documentation):

> 1. Select Help, then Install New Software... from the menu bar.
> 2. Click the dropdown and select the "Luna" site as shown.
> 3. Scroll down to the Programming Languages section and click the arrow to expand.
> 4. Choose Eclipse Java Development Tools
> 5. Click Next.
> 6. Take the defaults for the other options and let Eclipse restart.
> 
> When these steps are finished, and Eclipse has restarted, Java should be an available option on the Preferences window, and all the Java perspectives will be available.
